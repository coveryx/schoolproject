<p style="text-align:center">⋆｡‧˚ʚ🌷ɞ˚‧｡⋆<br>Kung ako ay magiging totoo para sa sarili ko, sasabihin ko na hindi ko alam kung paano ko sisimulan ang liham na ito.
<br>Mahirap magsimula ng liham lalo na kung sarili mo ang kakausapin mo. As I mark this day, March 18, 2025, let this letter be a reminder of who you once were. (14 years old you trying to figure out code with this project.) </p>
<p style="text-align:center">First of all, how are you? Kamusta na yung mga bagay na gusto mo mapagaling? Hopefully you've fully recovered after years of hoping. :) I know that life was too much for you during your
  teenage years, that it was hard to understand and bear during those times, but I'm proud of you for being able to get through it despite everything. Kung nababasa mo ito, then ibig sabihin non ay buhay ka pa rin and 
  still fighting. Additionally, I want to remind you to take care of yourself and don't give up! Alam na alam ko na madali kang mastress nowadays and your mentality is uhm..! something. Kaya please keep moving forward.
  Moving on, are you and Aqysha still together? Are you guys still as close as ever? Have you started dating or nagtagal ba kayo? Honestly, hindi ko talaga ineexpect yan si Lauvet, eh. She was a major 
  factor in our efforts to reconcile. Genuinely, I appreciate her as a person and my soulmate. The time we spent together was precious, and I am sure that you're also aware of our relationship with her. 
  I really hope that she's still there with us. Kahit na malayo kayo sa isa't isa, sana naman talaga nagtagal kayong dalawa. We've been out of the closet for many years, so we don't really mind the weird looks and 
  whispers that the people around us murmur. The disgusted, disappointing looks do not scare and worry us at all. As long as we love Aqy to our fullest, we will make them valuable as we promised. I'm aware that we're 
  very serious when it comes to promises talaga. Kaya if ever hindi natin kaya ipursue or gawin yung isang promise, we never agree to do so. Speaking of, close pa rin ba kayo ni Riri & Ray? Like, as in close na close? 
  Matagal na rin kasi nung nakita ko si Riri, considering she studies in a different school than Ray and I, so I can't help myself but question about them. I just know that you care for them dearly and that you wish 
  them well. If ever, sabihin mo sakanila na I love you o kahit mag randomly call ka sakanila, it's up to you naman. Sana rin na close pa rin kayo ng mga kaibigan mo from high school, and the people you met were 
  still present. Although, as you may know, people come and go. So yun nga, it's no use hoping for something to stay knowing that this saying exists. Pero tandaan mo pa rin to take it easy for yourself and to appreciate 
  every waking day that you spend with those people. May it be good or bad, those are still life lessons for you. Actuallyyyy, hindi pa talaga tayo halfway sa letter, pero I know that I've already said a lot. Kahit na 
  may mga grammatical errors and sudden shifts of topics, just bear with it, yeah? Ikaw naman ako so hehehe. Anyway, going back, have you taken the course you wanted? Napursue mo na ba ang pagiging psychologist or film 
  maker mo? It's either of the two talaga, so don't give up on me kasi I'm really counting on you! Kahit na you're from the future, and at this very moment I am in the present day, I hope you won't disappoint me knowing 
  that my actions now will take a hold of you. Making myself from the present time the cause of every consequence in the future. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">Oh diba, naging poetic pa. Ganyan ka kasi dati kaya be better talaga tsk tsk.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Sa pagpapatuloy, alam ko na may galit ka kay papa at the moment. Considering how this grudge has suddenly taken a toll on you these past months. I hope you'll soon find peace in your heart 
  and find the right time to open your emotions to our father. Although it is irritating and worrying that he doesn't listen and that he won't understand sometimes, still try. I know you're not one to hold rage or yun 
  nga grudge against someone. Ito lang naman ang pakiusap ko sa iyo, please make it up to him. Please, as someone who hasn't forgiven himself for years, please do this for me. Ever since bata palang tayo, close na natin 
  siya. Literal alam ng lahat na close tayo, that we have a powerful "father and son" dynamic sa isa't isa. So as someone who's used to my father's kindness, his complex teachings, and relentlessly annoying you when he 
  gets the chance, please apologize to him. Additionally, I would like to also remind you about our mother. Her efforts and thoughtful actions have led you to where you are right now (hopefully in a decent state). Alam 
  kong nakapagusap na kayo ni mama about sa conflict niyong dalawa, nagsabi pa nga siya sayo to clear out the tension sa pagitan niyo, eh. I'm proud of it, really. Kaya ipagpatuloy mo yung pagpapatawad ng mga tao. 
 <span style="color:#FF007F;font-weight:medium;">Live with love, chay.</span> Ipagpatuloy mo yung pagmamahal mo sa mga tao dahil walang pipigil sayo kundi ang sarili mo lamang. Natuto ka sa bawat yugto ng iyong buhay kaya 
  ako ay nagagalak na may oras ka upang basahin ang liham na ito.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Kaya pa ba basahin? Ready ka na ba para sa rant session ko? Rah.</p> 

<p style="text-align:center">Ito na nga, namomoblema ako sa sarili ko and I know you're the only one who could understand me. Hopefully nakapagaral ka na ng psych hehe ahhaah hahahhaha okay going back. I've been experiencing
conflicts within myself and the people around me. After some time of reflecting, I've noticed that I have been so aggressive and careless at times. Either I'd be too harsh to myself or to those surrounding me. Nakakatakot talaga.
Yung self-aware ka na nasasaktan mo na rin yung mga nakapaligid sa iyo pero hindi mo kayang makontrol ng maayos yung emosyon mo. Yung tipong hindi mo na talaga kayang itigil sarili mo kasi sobra na. Ito yung ayaw ko mangyari ulit
sa iyo. Minsan din ay naiirita ako sa mga kasapi ko sa paaralan. Alam ko naman na ginagawa ko ang lahat bilang isang officer, pero parang wala rin naman kwenta kung magtatanong lang sila na nasa announcement na? Don't get me wrong,
wala naman masama sa pagtatanong kapag hindi talaga malinaw yung instructions or hindi ko na elaborate further. Ngunit, yung mga tinatanong nila is yung mga nasagot ko na. Yung nakasabi na dun sa message + pubmat ko. Nakakapagod kaya
:/ Mageeffort ako sa pagiging class officer tapos committed ako pero what is it for me? I love people, really. It's just that they're complicated at some times that it's hard to keep up.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">My point is, people will always be people. We all have our differences, and we should appreciate that. Hindi lang naman ako yung namomoblema at mayroon din naman na ibang tao na nakakaranas nito. So it's
best to find the solution to it. Sorry kung sudden yung negativity :(. Pleasee PLEASEEE don't go back to this type of Mars. </p>
<p style="text-align:center">⋆｡‧˚ʚ🍀ɞ˚‧｡⋆</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">My last words for my future self.</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">All I ever ask for is for you to get better. Learn from your mistakes and forgive everyone. Mag ingat palagi and keep pursuing your dreams. Keep writing, keep understanding, and keep loving. <br>Despite everything,
it is still you.</p>
