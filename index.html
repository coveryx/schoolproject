<p style="text-align:center">Kung ako ay magiging totoo para sa sarili ko, sasabihin ko na hindi ko alam kung paano ko sisimulan ang liham na ito.
<br>Mahirap magsimula ng liham lalo na kung sarili mo ang kakausapin mo. As I mark this day, March 18, 2025, let this letter be a reminder of who you once were.
(14 years old you trying to figure out code with this project) </p>
<p style="text-align:center">First of all, how are you? Kamusta na yung mga bagay na gusto mo mapagaling? Hopefully you've fully recovered after years of hoping. :) 
I know that life was too much for you during your teenage years, 
that it was hard to understand and bear during those times, but I'm proud of you for being able to get through it despite everything. 
Kung nababasa mo ito, then ibig sabihin non ay buhay ka pa rin and still fighting. Moving on, are you and Aqysha still together? Are you guys still as close as ever?
Have you started dating orr nagtagal ba kayo? Honestly, hindi ko talaga ineexpect yan si Lauvet, eh. She was one of the reason why we're trying to get ourselves together.
Genuinely, I appreciate her as a person and my soulmate. The times we spend together was precious, and I am sure that you're also aware of our relationship with her.
I really hope that she's still there with us. Kahit na malayo kayo sa isa't isa, sana naman talaga nagtagal kayong dalawa. We've been out of the closet for many years so we don't really mind the weird looks
and whispers that the people around us murmurs. The disgusted, disappointing looks does not scare and worry us at all. As long as we love Aqy to our fullest, to make them valuable as we promised.
I'm aware na we're very serious when it comes to promises talaga. Kaya if ever hindi natin kaya ipursue or gawin yung isang promise, we never agree to do so.Speaking of, close pa rin ba kayo ni Riri & Ray? 
Like as in close na close? Matagal na rin kasi nung nakita ko si Riri, considering she studies in a different school than Ray and I, so I can't help myself but question about them. I just know that you care for them dearly, and
that you wish them well. If ever, sabihin mo sakanila na i love you o kahit mag randomly call ka sakanila, it's up to you naman. Sana rin na close pa rin kayo ng mga kaibigan mo from high school, and 
the people you met were still present. Although, as you may know, people come and go. So yun nga, it's no use hoping for something to stay knowing that this saying exist. Pero tandaan mo pa rin to take 
it easy for yourself and to appreciate every waking days that you spend with those people. May it be good or bad, those are still life lessons for you. Actuallyyyy, hindi pa talaga tayo half way sa letter 
pero I know that I've already said a lot. Kahit na may mga grammatical errors, and sudden shift of topics, just bear with it, yeah? Ikaw naman ako so hehehe. Anyway, going back, have you taken the course 
you wanted? Napursue mo na ba ang pagiging psychologist or film maker mo? It's either of the two talaga, so don't give up on me kasi I'm really counting on you! Kahit na you're from the future, and at this very
moment I am at the present day, I hope you won't disappoint me knowing that my actions now will take a hold of you. Making myself from the present time the cause of every consenquences in the future. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">Oh diba, naging poetic pa. Ganyan ka kasi dati kaya be better talaga tsk tsk.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Sa pagpapatuloy, alam ko na may galit ka kay papa at the moment. Considering how this grudge has suddenly taken a toll of you these past months. I hope you'll soon find peace in 
your heart, and find the right time to open your emotions to our father. Although, as much as irritating and worrying it is that he doesn't listen, that he won't understand, still try. I know you're not one
to hold rage or yun nga grudge against someone. Ito lang naman ang pakiusap ko sa iyo, please make it up to him. Please, as someone who haven't forgiven himself for years, please do this for me. Ever since bata 
palang tayo, close na natin siya. Literal alam ng lahat na close tayo, that we have a powerful "father and son" dynamic sa isa't isa. So as someone who's used to my father's kindness, his complex teachings,
and relentlessly annoying you when he gets the chance, please apologize to him. Additionally, I would like to also remind you about our mother. Her efforts and thoughtful actions has led you to where you are 
right now (hopefully in a decent state). Alam kong nakapagusap na kayo ni mama about sa conflict niyong dalawa, nagsabi pa nga siya sayo to clear out the tension sa pagitan niyo, eh. I'm proud of it, really.
Kaya ipagpatuloy mo yung pagpapatawad ng mga tao. Live with love, chay. Ipagpatuloy mo yung pagmamahal mo sa mga tao dahil walang pipigil sayo kundi ang sarili mo lamang. Natuto ka sa bawat yugto ng iyong buhay
kaya ako ay nagagalak na may oras ka upang basahin ang liham na ito. Kahit pang school project lamang ito, it is already considered as something bigger than what it is. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"> Since limitado lang ang aking oras at madami pa talaga akong gagawin other than this project, hindi ko alam kung mapapahaba ko pa ito. Madami ang gustong sabihin at itanong sayo,
siguro sa ibang araw nalang yun kasi medyo personal na siya.</p>

<p>At baka binabasa ito ni Ma'am, hi mam.</p>
